<p>
The love that could not be spoken from between his lips<br>
had never once touched the sun.
<span class="cn">
从他唇间无法宣之于口的爱尚未触及太阳
</span>
</p>

<p>
Not because it had dried —<br>
but because not a single drop had ever evaporated.<br>
It remained as it was,<br>
a bead of water rippling endlessly within his heart.
<span class="cn">
缘于一滴都未曾干涸，以原本的模样荡漾在心间的水滴
</span>
</p>

<p>
Yet if it were to remain still,<br>
that surging love would swallow even breath itself —<br>
drowning, suffocating, consuming him whole.
<span class="cn">
虽然如若静止不动，那汹涌的爱意会连呼吸都吞没殆尽悬溺窒息
</span>
</p>

<p>
And so, his love began in his eyes,<br>
spilling forth.
<span class="cn">
因此爱意始于他的眼底，倾泻而出
</span>
</p>

<p>
After he had dyed every inch of ancestral land<br>
into a river-deep emerald tide,<br>
his love still did not wither.
<span class="cn">
当他将祖先留下来的所有土地都浸染成了江河般的碧绿色彩后，他的爱仍未枯竭耗尽
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the end,<br>
he buried his own head beneath this terrain —<br>
neither river nor earth, but a sensual continent of longing —<br>
and ceased to breathe.
<span class="cn">
于是他最终将自己的头颅深埋进这片既不能称之为江河又不能称之为大地的情色陆地之下停止了呼吸
</span>
</p>

<p>
He clasped in his palm<br>
the long-awaited arrival of peace.
<span class="cn">
将终于降临的安宁紧紧握于掌心
</span>
</p>
