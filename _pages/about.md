I am a PhD student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC Irvine.

My research focuses on:

- Micro-scale flow boiling
- Computer vision based bubble tracking
- Two-phase heat transfer modeling
- GPU cooling systems

I combine high-speed imaging, machine learning, and thermal-fluid modeling to understand two-phase heat transfer mechanisms.
